# Telecom-Customer-Churn

Performed feature engineering using univariate analysis, bivariate analysis, outlier treatment and feature selection for the features.
Built and trained model using classification algorithms of Logistic regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boost.
Chose Gradient Boost as the final model by comparing its performance with other models (Better accuracy (80%), better F1 score (57%) comparative to other models).
Identified possible churners and came up with suggestions to lower 
customer churn rate and increase customer retention.
